# PEKISH-Snack-Website-Prototype-
Pekish is an online shopping site that allows customers to purchase from a vast selection of snacks and drinks. We at Pekish will act as the middlemen in your ordering process by providing users with website and store information in order to get their items  Along with the standard selection of goods, users will be able to purchase international products from places such as the UK, Russia, and even Eastern Asian countries such as Japan. Lastly, a miscellaneous section which provides party snacks such as PaQui’s One Chip challenge and Jelly Belly Bean Boozeled will be made available to customers. A database will be created in order to hold the website resources such as product information and user login information.
